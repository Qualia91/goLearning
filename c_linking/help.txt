Example of static linking from c to go
use:
    go build -buildmode=c-archive main.go
to build go file as static library
Then create a main.c that includes the library and uses a function from it
Then use:
    cc main.c ./main.a -lpthread
to create the c exe, and ./a.out to run


to create shared library, build with flag c-shared main.go.
you also dont need the -lpthread at end of cc compile
