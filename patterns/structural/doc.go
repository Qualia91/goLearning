/*The structural package.

This package contains the following patterns:

- Facade: Serves as a front end interface masking complex underlying or structural code.
- Proxy: Provides a placeholder for another object, and controls access to another object, allowing for work to be done around calling object.
- Adapater: Allows the interface of a class to be used as another interface. Basically wrappes objects so they can work with other objects.
