/*The microservices package.

Need to scope microservices. Can do this via Bounded Contexts (borrowed from Domain Driven Design).

Bounded Contexts:
Each BC represents a domain function.
A specific responsibility enforced by explicit boundary.
Has internal models which can change separate from external models which don't change, and communication between the
2 is shared and well defined.
