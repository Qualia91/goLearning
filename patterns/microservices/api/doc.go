/*API based architecture.

Functional requirements:
1) Loosly coupled
2) Independently changable
3) Independently deployable
4) Support and honor contracts
5) Technology agnostic API
6) Statless API

API Architectural Styles
- Pragmatic REST:
		Uses HTTP based infrastructure
		Use uniform resource interface (post, put, get and delete)
		Calls resource endpoints (www.site.com/a/b/c)
		Client-Server based (Server knows nothing about client)
		Stateless
		Cacheable
		Layered system
		Self descriptive method
- HATEOS
- RPC
- SOAP

Patterns:
- Facade Pattern
- Proxy Pattern
- Stateless service pattern
